## Introduction

The Inventory Management App is created to make inventory management easier for small to medium-sized businesses. It allows users to view and track stock levels, perform stocktakes, and manage inventory efficiently.

## Features

- **User authentication with JWT (JSON Web Tokens)** for secure login.
- **Role-based access control:** Normal users can view stock levels and perform basic operations, while admin users have full control over the inventory.
- **Real-time stock tracking:** Inventory changes are updated in real-time for quick and accurate data access.
- **Intuitive and user-friendly interface** for ease of use.

## Technologies Used

The project is built using the MERN stack:
- **MongoDB.js:** A NoSQL database for efficient and flexible data storage.
- **Express.js:** A fast and minimalist web framework for Node.js, providing robust APIs and server-side functionalities.
- **React.js:** A popular front-end library for building user interfaces.
- **Node.js:** A server-side runtime environment for running JavaScript code.

Other key technologies and tools used include:
- **React Router:** For handling client-side routing.
- **Axios:** For making HTTP requests to the server.
- **Bootstrap:** For responsive and mobile-friendly UI components.
- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens):** For secure user authentication.
- **Git:** For version control and collaboration.
