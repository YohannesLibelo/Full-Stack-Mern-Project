All the deploying sites that are recommended are asking for my payment details and it was difficult to find free deploying service. Especially Heroku. 
In addition my bootcamp is expiring tomorrow and I would appreciate it if the marker could focus on the main requirements of the MERN application as I demonstrated a good understanding of the concept. If not the bootcamp is going to expire and I wouldnâ€™t be able to access my  dashboard, the feeback and  I have to enroll again to access it. 

Thank you 

RE:
//new comments 

I have made all the changes however  this specific comment isnt being reflecting on my side -   "When logged in with the admin credentials, I tried to add stock however upon clicking the submit button I was automatically logged out of the application" and an admins can add a sttock and not be logged out.
